                    <p>A game where you make pancakes to get profit, but this is not a traditional IGM game. Here you make pancakes by actually making them (Not Really. Mainly due to problems actually making it happen). Make Pancakes to make different kinds and get collectibles like Achievements and Useless Icons.</p>

					<p><a href = "https://rylieeric.neocities.org/posts/2023-01-08-PM-Pancake-Maker">Rylie wanted to make a unique game on IGM</a>, so she decided to work on several ideas throughout 2019, including what would end up being Pancake Maker. Pancake Maker ended up taking full focus and she worked on it for several hours a week. The cooking process was done in order and without much regard for bugs.

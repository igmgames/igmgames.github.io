                    <p>Here you can find some cool games made in IGM (well, kind of).</p>
                    <p>This section changes based on what page you are on. For example, if you were on a game page, this section will have related links and other information instead of what you see here. Take a look, perhaps?</p>

					<h1>Recovering Save Files for Deleted Games</h1>
					<p>The only way to recover save files for deleted games is to use the browser's console. This is useful for testing or transfering from a deleted version of a game to a non-delete one.</p>
					<p>One way to do this is to your browser's console and enter this (pastebin example is used).</p>
					<p><i>window.localStorage.getItem("http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=old paste id")</i></p>
                    <p>The output can be copied to a text file and then can be used in a different version of the game.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>Another way to do this is the use IGM's own console functions. This is more complex, but you can read about them <a href = "https://scrambledrubiks.neocities.org/projects/igm/consoleguide">in this guide</a> by ScrambledRubiks.</p>
					<p>Shoutouts to Lookas for making the community aware of this.</p>

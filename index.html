                    <p>Here you can find some cool games made in IGM (well, kind of).</p>
                    <p>This section changes based on what page you are on. For example, if you were on a game page, this section will have related links and other information instead of what you see here. Take a look, perhaps?

							<li>Keeping my promise on bi-monthly updates here (even though this update only really came out of necessity).</li>
							<li>Notice has been added to the home page regarding issues with Pastebin.</li>
							<li>Game ids have been changed to use a simplier title based system instead of having special shorten forms, so new game ids going forward will be based off their entire title. Existing game ids will be unchanged.</li>
							<li>Updated the numbers below (plus the ones from the last update since I counted one extra.</li>
							<li>13/300 Games With Completed Pages</li>
							<li>17/300 Documented Games Added With Pages</li>

						<h2>Important Notice</h2>
						<p>Pastebin games currently cannot be accessed through the usual method and can only be accessed through raw links (like for other sites). It is unknown if this is a permanent change or a bug. Regardless, these links <s>will be fixed throughout the rest of March and through April</s> have been fixed. If you have save data you want to retrieve, please refer to <a href = "./guides/tips.html">this guide</a>.</p>
